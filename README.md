## About The Eye

Expenditure is an outflow of money that is used to obtain profits in the form of goods or services that can be grouped by time. There are many ways to record expense transactions in the hope of being able to manage financially, especially for millennials and generation Z who tend to have FOMO and YOLO traits. So far, someone who takes notes has been assisted by many applications and some even don't use application assistance at all. The tendency of someone who is lazy and always relies on convenience is a reason to be reluctant to pay attention to financial management. On the other hand, some financial management applications generally only help record and allocate users' finances which creates the impression of repetitive activities that will be experienced by users. The Eye helping the younger generation to forecast their spending based on historical transaction data more easily

## Features

### Forecasting (line chart and data list)
Expenses forecasting is carried out using the simple moving average method which is displayed in the form of line charts and data list
### Grouping Data
Enter your data  and view easily with grouping by date
### Margin error with Mean Absolute Error
Every forecast is expected to be accurate, therefore we present the mean absolute error method to calculate the average absolute difference between the actual value and the predicted (forecasting) value.
